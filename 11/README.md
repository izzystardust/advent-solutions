# AOC day 11
   
## Facts
Perl 5 can do string arithmetics with "digits" 'a' to 'z'!

## Files
* 11.pl - slight variant of concise day 11 solution.
    Two regexes were shortened.
* 11_strict_varint.pl - same, but using `strict` etc.
    Checks for 8 lowercase letters a-z (stated condition ad-hoc true).
